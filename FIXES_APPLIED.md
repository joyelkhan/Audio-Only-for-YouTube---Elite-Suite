# 🔧 Fixes Applied - Audio Only for YouTube™

## Issues Fixed (October 29, 2025)

### ❌ Problems Reported:
1. Extension was hiding other YouTube videos
2. Play/Pause button not working
3. Next/Previous (skip) buttons not working  
4. Too much of the YouTube interface was hidden

### ✅ Solutions Implemented:

#### 1. **Only Hide Video Canvas**
- **Before**: Entire YouTube player was hidden
- **After**: Only the `<video>` element is hidden
- **Result**: YouTube controls, thumbnails, and other videos remain visible

**Changes Made:**
- `ui-manager.js`: Updated `hideVideoElements()` to target only `video` element
- `overrides.css`: Changed CSS to hide only `video`, not entire player
- Video is now invisible but audio still plays

#### 2. **Fixed Button Click Handlers**
- **Before**: Buttons weren't responding to clicks
- **After**: All buttons work properly with proper event handling

**Changes Made:**
- Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent conflicts
- Added null checks before adding event listeners
- Added error handling for play/pause operations

#### 3. **Improved UI Insertion**
- **Before**: Custom UI replaced entire player
- **After**: Custom UI is inserted at top of player container

**Changes Made:**
- UI is now inserted into `#movie_player` instead of replacing it
- Video element is hidden with CSS, not removed
- Original YouTube controls remain functional
