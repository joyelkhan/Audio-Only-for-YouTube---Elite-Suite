# Bug Fix: Skin Selector UI insertBefore Error

## 🐛 Issue Resolved

**Error:** `Uncaught NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node': The node before which the new node is to be inserted is not a child of this node.`

**Location:** `content-scripts/skin-selector-ui.js:72`

**Context:** Error occurred when playing YouTube videos

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

The code was attempting to insert the skin selector button before the settings button using:

```javascript
const settingsBtn = controls.querySelector('.ytp-settings-button');
if (settingsBtn) {
    controls.insertBefore(this.button, settingsBtn);
}
```

**Problem:** `querySelector()` searches the entire subtree, so `settingsBtn` might exist but not be a **direct child** of `controls`. When `insertBefore()` is called with a reference node that isn't a direct child, it throws a `NotFoundError`.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Added parent node validation before attempting insertion:

```javascript
const settingsBtn = controls.querySelector('.ytp-settings-button');
if (settingsBtn && settingsBtn.parentNode === controls) {
    controls.insertBefore(this.button, settingsBtn);
} else {
    controls.appendChild(this.button);
}
```

**Change:** Added `&& settingsBtn.parentNode === controls` check

**Result:** The button is only inserted before `settingsBtn` if it's a direct child of `controls`. Otherwise, it's safely appended to the end.

## 🧪 Testing

After this fix:
- ✅ No more `insertBefore` errors in console
- ✅ Skin selector button appears correctly on YouTube player
- ✅ Works across different YouTube layouts and player states
- ✅ Gracefully handles edge cases where settings button location varies
