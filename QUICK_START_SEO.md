## ‚ùì FAQ

### Do I have to rename the repository?
**YES.** This is the most important step. The current name has double dashes and vague branding that hurts SEO.

### Will renaming break anything?
No. GitHub automatically redirects old URLs to the new name. But you must update your local git remote.

### Can I keep "Elite Suite" branding?
You can, but it will significantly hurt your SEO. "Elite Suite" has zero search volume. "Audio Player" has thousands of monthly searches.

### What if I already submitted to Chrome Web Store?
You can update your listing at any time. Use the content from `CHROME_STORE_LISTING.md`.

### How long until I see results?
- GitHub: 1-2 weeks
- Google: 3-4 weeks
- Significant traffic: 2-3 months
