# ✅ SURGICAL MODE APPLIED - Audio Only YouTube Elite

## 🎯 **What Changed: Surgical Approach**

The extension now uses a **surgical approach** that:
- ✅ **Hides ONLY the video canvas** (the actual video rendering)
- ✅ **Preserves ALL YouTube UI** (controls, buttons, suggestions, comments)
- ✅ **Keeps all functionality working** (play, pause, next, previous, volume, etc.)
- ✅ **Shows minimal audio overlay** (optional animated waves)

## 📋 **Settings**

New simplified settings:

- ~~Auto Theater Mode~~ (user controls this)
- ~~Show Performance Stats~~ (simplified)

## 🔍 **Technical Details**

### How It Works:

1. **Video Hiding**:
```javascript
video.style.opacity = '0';
video.style.visibility = 'hidden';
video.style.position = 'absolute';
video.style.zIndex = '-1';
```

2. **UI Preservation**:
```css
.audio-only-surgical-active .ytp-button {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    z-index: 9999 !important;
    pointer-events: auto !important;
}
```

3. **Minimal Overlay**:
- Positioned absolutely over video area
- `pointer-events: none` - doesn't block clicks
- Animated sound waves for visual feedback
- "🎧 AUDIO ONLY" badge

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### Controls not working?
- Make sure you reloaded the extension
- Refresh the YouTube page (F5)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Video still showing?
- Toggle extension off and on again
- Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check that surgical mode is active (console logs)

### Overlay blocking controls?
- This shouldn't happen (`pointer-events: none`)
- If it does, disable "Show Audio Visualization" in settings
