It's the perfect free alternative for users who primarily want background audio playback without paying for a subscription.

### **Does this work for YouTube Music?**
Yes! The YouTube Audio Player works perfectly with YouTube Music, allowing you to listen to your music library, playlists, and recommendations in audio-only mode with background playback. Save data while enjoying your favorite music.
