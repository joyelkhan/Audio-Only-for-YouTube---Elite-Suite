## üìù Coding Guidelines

### JavaScript Style

```javascript
// Use ES6+ features
const myFunction = async () => {
    // Arrow functions for callbacks
    const result = await someAsyncOperation();
    return result;
};

// Clear variable names
const isAudioModeActive = true;  // Good
const flag = true;                // Bad

// Comments for complex logic
// Calculate bandwidth savings based on video quality
const savings = calculateSavings(quality);
```

### Code Quality Rules

1. **Use meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
2. **Keep functions small** - one responsibility per function
3. **Add comments** for complex logic, not obvious code
4. **Handle errors** - always use try-catch for async operations
5. **Avoid global variables** - use modules and classes
6. **Use const/let** - never use var
7. **Consistent formatting** - 4 spaces for indentation

### CSS Style

```css
/* Use BEM-like naming */
.audio-player-container { }
.audio-player__controls { }
.audio-player__button--active { }

/* Group related properties */
.element {
    /* Positioning */
    position: relative;
    top: 0;
    
    /* Display & Box Model */
    display: flex;
    width: 100%;
    padding: 10px;
    
    /* Visual */
    background: #fff;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
    
    /* Typography */
    font-size: 14px;
    color: #333;
    
    /* Misc */
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

### File Organization

- **One class per file** when possible
- **Group related functions** together
- **Export at the bottom** of the file
- **Imports at the top** of the file
